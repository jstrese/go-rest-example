## Summary

Small restful API server that connects to a PostgreSQL database to create and return blog posts. Nothing extreme, incomplete even. This is my entry to the Golang universe :)

## Development

To start just run 'nodemon'. The nodemon.json file contains necessary settings to make it work with Go.
